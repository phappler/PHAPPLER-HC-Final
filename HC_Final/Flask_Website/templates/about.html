		Purpose
	</h3>
	<p>
		This website was created as a final project for CHIN 370 - Hacking Chinese Studies. The goal of this project is to run a sentiment analysis on various important texts throughout Chinese history to see how sentiment on various topics has changed over time, as well as providing a good way to display this data.

	<h3>
		Sentiment Analysis
	</h3>
	<p>
		Sentiment analysis is a technique that determines how positive or negative a text portrays a certain topic. 
	</p>
	<h3>
		Text Selection
	</h3>
	<p>
		As I am not familiar with many texts from Chinese history, the texts I chose were selected from the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Chinese_texts">Timeline of Chinese texts</a></i> on wikipedia. The texts themselves were pulled from the <i><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a></i> database.
	</p>
	<h3>
		The Algorithm
	</h3>
	<p>
		This algorithm used the NLTK VADER module to sort the input text by which sections have both the highest positive and negative sentiment values.
